# Phone browsers

# Browsers to avoid

**Opera Browser** owned by the Chinese and is a complete Spyware, *Opera makes 55 unsolicited requests upon its first run. By default, it spies on all your browsing history. Works closely with advertisers and trackers. Is integrated with Facebook, one of the biggest privacy violators in the world.* **WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T USE IT, WORST BROWSER TO CHOOSE**.

**Google Chrome**, mainly because it uses Google and is made and owned by Google. Google tracks you and uses your information for advertising. If you use Google at least use one of the browsers provided above, ex. Iridium, Bromite.
